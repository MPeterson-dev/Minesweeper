    <ul style="font-family:Bungee">
        <li>Objective: Uncover all the squares on the grid without detonating any mines.</li>
        <li>Grid: The game is played on a grid of squares, which can vary in size.</li>
        <li>Mines: Some squares contain hidden mines. The number of mines is predetermined.</li>
        <li>Numbers: Uncovered squares display a number that indicates how many mines are in the adjacent squares (diagonals included).
        <li>Empty Squares: If a square doesn't have any neighboring mines, it will show an zero when uncovered, and its adjacent squares will also be automatically uncovered.</li>
        <!--<li>Flagging: You can flag a square by right-clicking (or using an equivalent action) if you suspect it contains a mine. This helps you keep track of potential mine locations.</li>-->
        <li>Uncovering: Left-click on a square to uncover it. If it's a mine, you lose the game. If it's empty, a number indicates how many mines are nearby.</li>
        <li>Winning: You win when all non-mined squares are uncovered. This requires careful deduction to avoid mines and uncover the safe squares.</li>
        <li>Losing: You lose the game if you uncover a square containing a mine. The game ends at this point.</li>
        <!--<li>Restarting: You can restart the game at any time to start over with a new arrangement of mines and empty squares.</li>-->
        <!--Logic and Deduction: To progress, use the numbers to deduce where mines are located. If a number indicates there are, for example, 2 adjacent mines, and you've flagged 2 potential mines, the remaining adjacent squares are safe to uncover.-->
        <li>Guessing: In some situations, you might need to make an educated guess when there's no logical move left. This can lead to either uncovering more safe squares or accidentally hitting a mine.</li>
    </ul>
